== DESCRIPTION ==

*A full checkout experience embedded on your site with Pay Now, Pay Later and Slice It. No credit card numbers, no passwords, no worries.*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XayUzOUkyDQ

Our complete checkout is a seamless and mobile optimized solution that delivers a best-in-class user experience that comes with all our payment methods. It also identifies the customer and enables one-click repeat purchases across Klarna’s merchant network, resulting in increased average order value, conversions, and loyalty.

This official Klarna extension also makes it easy for you to handle orders in WooCommerce after a purchase is complete. With a single click of a button, you can activate, update, refund and cancel orders directly from WooCommerce without logging into the Klarna administration.

=== Pay Now (direct payments) ===
Customers who want to pay in full at checkout can do it quickly and securely with a credit/debit card. Friction-free direct purchases while maximising the value for your business thanks to guaranteed payments. If they have a Klarna account they can save their details and enjoy one-click purchases from then on.

=== Pay later (invoice) ===
Try it first, pay it later. Delayed payments for customers who like low friction purchases and to pay after delivery.

=== Slice it (installments) ===
Installment, revolving and other flexible financing plans let customers pay when they can and when they want.

=== How to Get Started ===
* [Sign up for Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/international/business/woocommerce/).
* [Install the plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/klarna-checkout-for-woocommerce/) on your site. During this process you will be asked to download [Klarna Order Management](https://wordpress.org/plugins/klarna-order-management-for-woocommerce/) so you can handle orders in Klarna directly from WooCommerce.
* Get your store approved by Klarna, and start selling.

=== What's the difference between Klarna Checkout and Klarna Payments? ===
Klarna as your single payment provider keeps everything under one roof. You’ll have one agreement, one point of contact, one settlement file, one payout with __Klarna Checkout__. It only takes a single integration to deliver the full Klarna hosted checkout experience through a widget placed on your site.
